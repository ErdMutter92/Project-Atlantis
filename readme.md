Project Atlantis
-----------------------------------------------------------
Project Atlantis is a Minecraft server web portal. The aim of the application is to build a website that is both useful and easy to use for aquiring information about the Minecraft server it is attached to. 

Current Feature Set
* LanteaCraft Stargate Database
* Mojang Server/Service Status
* Server Population Information
* Server Status Information
* Player Profiles
* Blog/News Page
* Screenshot Gallery
* Node (ExpressJs) backend /w Caching
 
We are working on getting feature parity with the previuse version, which was not released online. The feature set of version 0.0.2 are as followed:
* ~LanteaCraft Stargate Database~
* ~Mojang Server/Service Status~
* ~Server Population Information~
* ~Server Status Information~
* Omni Search Field
* ~Blog/News Page~
* ComputerCraft source code repository
* ~Screenshot Gallery~

This project is still in it's infincy, and badly needs tests. Project Atlantis is not considered stable enough for deployment for use on other servers. This will likely remain the same until a 1.0.0 release.

Current Version: 0.0.3

ToDos
* API Security (Critical)
* Omni Search Field (Low)
* ComputerCraft Source Code Repository (Medium)
